# Bouncing-Ball
Using basic 2D kinematic motion, a bouncing ball that can be "blown" by wind will be simulated using the Java AWT and swing toolset
If you decide to try and run this program, simply press the "u" key to cause the ball to bounce, and the "w" key to apply a wind force to the ball. Here's a demo!
